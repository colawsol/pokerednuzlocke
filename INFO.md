# Info

## To Do

### Permadeath
* Prevent fainted Pokémon from being revived in all circumstances.

### Encounters
* Only allow first encounter in each area to be caught.

### Miscellaneous
* Provide access to HM-compatible Pokémon to prevent being unable to progress due to available encounters.

## Changelog
* Fainted Pokémon are no longer revived during party-healing events, e.g. using Pokémon Centers, talking to Mom etc (except immediately after the first rival battle).
* Revives and Max Revives have been removed from the game.
* Fainted Pokémon cannot be taken into the Cable Club or used for in-game trades.
* Rare Candies have no effect on fainted Pokémon, preventing a quirk where they can be used for revival.
* Fainted Pokémon cannot be deposited into the Daycare, as withdrawing them would restore their HP.
* Fainted Pokémon cannot evolve, preventing them from regaining HP.
