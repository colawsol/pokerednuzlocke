# Info

## To Do

### Permadeath
* Prevent fainted Pokémon from being revived in all circumstances.

### Encounters
* Only allow first encounter in each area to be caught.

### Miscellaneous
* Provide access to HM-compatible Pokémon to prevent being unable to progress due to available encounters.

## Changelog
* Fainted Pokémon are no longer revived during party-healing events, e.g. using Pokémon Centers, talking to Mom etc (except immediately after the first rival battle).
* Revives and Max Revives have been removed from the game.
* Fainted Pokémon cannot be taken into the Cable Club or used for in-game trades.
* Rare Candies have no effect on fainted Pokémon, preventing a quirk where they can be used for revival.
* Fainted Pokémon cannot be deposited into the Daycare, as withdrawing them would restore their HP.
* Fainted Pokémon cannot evolve, preventing them from regaining HP.
* Wild encounters are logged after obtaining Balls or entering the Safari Zone and only the first encounter in each area can be caught.
	* Encounters are logged when a wild Pokémon is fainted, captured or escaped from (either by running or using a Poké Doll, unless escaping from a ghost or ghost Marowak); when an encounter ends through either party using Teleport, Roar or Whirlwind; and when a wild Pokémon flees from the player (i.e. in the Safari Zone).
