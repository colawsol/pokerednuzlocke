N.B. Check the Changelog in INFO.md for a detailed list of differences.

### v0.0.1
pret/pokered disassembly.

### v1.0.0
Basic Nuzlocke rules enforced: fainted Pokémon can no longer be revived (except following the first rival battle) or traded away and only the first encounter in each area can be caught. Individual floors of dungeons etc (e.g. Mt Moon, Pokémon Tower) are counted as separate areas and duplicate encounters can be re-rolled, accommodating those who would choose to play with these clauses while others can simply choose to ignore them. There are no restrictions on accepting gift Pokémon or obtaining Game Corner prizes and the starter Pokémon is not counted as a Pallet Town encounter. There are also no specific consequences for blacking-out. Limited testing performed.
