# Credits

Lots of other people's work has been influential in making this project a possibility. If you think you deserve to be included here, please let me know.

* The pret members, for their work on the pokered disassembly and the disassembly of other Pokémon games that have been useful references.
* The Pokémon community as a whole, for their numerous and well-maintained forums. A specific mention is due to Lunos for their tutorials on setups for building pokered.
* Keith from the YouTube channel ChibiAkumas, for their tutorials on assembly programming. A specific mention is due to the 'Learn Multi platform Z80 Assembly Programming... With Vampires!' series.
* freeCodeCamp.org and Gwendolyn Faraday, for their 'Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course' video.
* Vincent Driessen, for their 'A successful Git branching model' blog post.
* The Stack Overflow community, who's forum seemed to be at the top of the search results for every question I had regarding compiling code or using git.
* Pokémon-ROM hackers collectively, for their shared projects that have been both inspirational and informative references. A specific mention is due to Sanqui and their pokered-randomizer project. I intended to use the landmark concept from pokecrystal for logging encounters in this project, but my first attempts to do so were unsuccessful. I came across Sanqui's project during research, which provided the answers I needed to move on with this project while I work on my original idea. Sanqui's code ended up being incorporated into the way I am currently logging evolutions too.
